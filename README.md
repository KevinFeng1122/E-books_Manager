# E-books_Manager

[Screenshots of the software have been uploaded to show its function. Please view them in the "Screenshot" folder.]

This software was developed in 2012 Spring with sponsorship from Univ. of Sci & Tech. Beijing. An older version developed using VB 6 was abandoned since the programming language and the user interface are rather outdated.

Features:

(1) Allowed users to classify their e-books according to multiple criteria e.g. author, publish date, topic â€“ an innovative feature that contemporary e-book management software in Chinese market did not have. Please consider the Windows explorer for comparison.

(2) Provided multiple practical functions such as file operations, web/local search, book lists making (export list to Excel files) and reading history.

Yifei independently completed the software development using VB.NET and Access database.
